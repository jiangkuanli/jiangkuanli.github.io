# 👋 About Me
&emsp;&emsp;I am **Jiangkuanli**, a first-year master's student in Artificial Intelligence at the **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)**, where I was admitted through recommendation without an entrance exam. I earned my B.Eng. degree in **Artificial Intelligence** from **Yangzhou University** in July 2025. 

&emsp;&emsp;My research interests focus on **transfer learning, cross-modal retrieval and person re-identification**. I am dedicated to exploring innovative approaches that push the boundaries of intelligent systems and their applications.  

&emsp;&emsp;If you are interested in my work, feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:jiangkuanli@163.com.com), connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Re-ljk), or visit my [personal academic blog](https://www.leejk-magic.top/) for research updates and project insights. I am always open to collaborations and academic exchanges.
