# 👋 About Me
&emsp;&emsp;I am **Jiangkuan Li**, a first-year master's student in Software Engineering at the **University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)**, where I was admitted through recommendation without an entrance exam. I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Artificial Intelligence from **Yangzhou University** in June 2025.

&emsp;&emsp;My research interests focus on **🔄 transfer learning, 🖼️cross-modal retrieval and 🕵️‍♂️person re-identification**. I am dedicated to exploring innovative approaches that push the boundaries of intelligent systems and their applications.  

&emsp;&emsp;If you are interested in my work, feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:jiangkuanli@163.com.com), connect with me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Re-ljk) or visit my [personal blog](https://www.leejk-magic.top/) for research updates and project insights. I am always open to collaborations and academic exchanges.
